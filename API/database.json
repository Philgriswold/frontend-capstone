      "category": "Tonkotsu & Gyokai Double Soup",
      "description": "The house specialty is a velvety tonkotsu gyokai soup with the tiniest hint of sweetness. The chashu topping is sliced paper-thin and roasted in a way that calls to mind high-quality ham or bacon. Both the menma and soft-boiled egg are superb. Tiny slivers of yuzu peel top it off with some freshness."

      "description": "Thick, creamy, mind-blowing soup, laden with liquefied chunks of pork and fish matter that stick to the handmade dipping noodles marvelously. The noodles are thick, chewy and house-made. The chashu slabs are succulent and fatty."

      "category": "Shio & Shoyu w/ Hamaguri Clams",
      "description": "The soup is a light, clear triple blend of Hamaguri clams, sea bream and dried gyokai (sea ingredients). On top of the bowls come extravagances like porcini mushroom duxelles sauce, golden inca berry sauce, white truffle oil and pancetta bacon bits. Noodles are homemade in the shop using six types of flour. "
